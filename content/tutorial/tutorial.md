In this tutorial, we'll go through the steps required to create a Relish test suite for a simple task management application.

You can find the completed code in the [example-selenide](https://github.com/dogriffiths/relish/tree/master/examples/selenide/example-selenide) folder of the repo. When completed, the tutorial will run this sequence of automated tests:
