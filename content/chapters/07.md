## Nobody wants to spend their life reinventing the wheel
 Most applications include classes whose main purpose is to store data, so to make your coding life easier, the Kotlin developers came up with the concept of a data class. Here, you’ll learn how data classes enable you to write code that’s cleaner and more concise than you ever dreamed was possible. You’ll explore the data class utility functions, and discover how to destructure a data object into its component parts. Along the way, you’ll find out how default parameter values can make your code more flexible, and we’ll introduce you to Any, the mother of all superclasses.
