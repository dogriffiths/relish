## A superclass inheritance hierarchy is just the beginning 
If you want to fully exploit polymorphism, you need to design using abstract classes and interfaces. In this chapter, you’ll discover how to use abstract classes to control which classes in your hierarchy can and can’t be instantiated. You’ll see how they can force concrete subclasses to provide their own implementations. You’ll find out how to use interfaces to share behavior between independent classes. And along the way, you’ll learn the ins and outs of is, as and when.
