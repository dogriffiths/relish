## Ever found yourself thinking that an object’s type would be perfect if you could just change a few things?
Well, that’s one of the advantages of inheritance. Here, you’ll learn how to create subclasses, and inherit the properties and functions of a superclass. You’ll discover how to override functions and properties to make your classes behave the way you want, and you’ll find out when this is (and isn’t) appropriate. Finally, you’ll see how inheritance helps you avoid duplicate code, and how to improve your flexibility with polymorphism.
