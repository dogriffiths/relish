## It’s time we looked beyond Kotlin’s basic types 
Sooner or later, you’re going to want to use something more than Kotlin’s basic types. And that’s where classes come in. Classes are templates that allow you to create your own types of objects, and define their properties and functions. Here, you’ll learn how to design and define classes, and how to use them to create new types of objects. You’ll meet constructors, initializer blocks, getters and setters, and you’ll discover how they can be used to protect your properties. Finally, you’ll learn how data hiding is built into all Kotlin code, saving you time, effort and a multitude of keystrokes.
