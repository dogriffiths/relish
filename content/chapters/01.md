## Kotlin is making waves
From it’s first official release, Kotlin has impressed programmers with its **friendly syntax, conciseness, flexibility and power**. In this book, we’ll teach you how to **build your own Kotlin applications**, and we’ll start by getting you to build a basic application and run it.
