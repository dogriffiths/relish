Our aim in creating Relish was to make tests so straightforward to create that developers would be able to write tests *before* creating their user-interfaces.\n\n# What does a Relish test look like?\n\nRelish is typically used combined with Cucumber tests and a UI testing library like Selenide (web) or Espresso (Android). \n\nIf you create a Cucumber test like the following:\n\n    Scenario: I can log in \n    \tGiven I have logged in with username 'freda' and password 'password1'\n    \tThen I will be on the home page\n    \t\n\nYou will need to create *step* code for the lines beginning `Given...` and `Then...`. With Relish, these steps will look like this:\n\n    ...\n    @Given(\"^I have logged in with username '([^']*)' and password '([^']*)'$\")\n    public void givenIHaveLoggedIn(String username, String password)\n    {\n        loginPage.launch();\n        loginPage.username().setStringValue(username);\n        loginPage.password().setStringValue(password);\n        loginPage.loginButton().click();\n    }\n    \n    @Then(\"^I will be on the home page$\")\n    public void thenIWillBeOnTheHomePage()\n    {\n        homePage.assertVisible();\n    }\n    ...\n    \nThe steps interact with Relish testing components like `loginPage.username()` which represent components that appear within a web page. Relish makes it easy to create and re-use these components, and to set and check their values. \n\n# Installing Relish\n\nIf you are using Relish for web testing and you are building your test project with `gradle`, these are the dependencies you will need in your `build.gradle` file:\n\n    apply plugin: 'java'\n    \n    sourceCompatibility = 1.8\n    \n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\n    \n    dependencies {\n        testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'\n        testCompile group: 'info.cukes', name: 'cucumber-java', version: '1.2.5'\n        testCompile group: 'info.cukes', name: 'cucumber-junit', version: '1.2.5'\n        testCompile group: 'com.codeborne', name: 'selenide', version: '4.8'\n        testCompile group: 'org.hamcrest', name:'java-hamcrest', version: '2.0.0.0'\n        testCompile 'com.github.dogriffiths.relish:relish-core:0.0.204'\n        testCompile 'com.github.dogriffiths.relish:relish-selenide:0.0.204'\n    }\n\n    ",
